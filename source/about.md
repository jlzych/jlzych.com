<h1 class="about-headline">Hi, I'm Jeff.</h1>

<h2 class="about-subheadline">I'm a designer, developer, and writer based in San Francisco.</h2>

I'm currently Head of Design at [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com "Optimizely homepage"). Before becoming a manager I was a Product Designer and a [UI Engineer](https://medium.com/design-optimizely/why-we-hire-ui-engineers-on-optimizely-s-design-team-b2a789553b79#.a0dzb4xyl).

Before joining Optimizely, I earned my Master's degree at UC Berkeley's [School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu "School of Information's homepage"), where I studied human-computer interaction, usability, and behavioral economics.

I'm also a tennis player and musician (guitar/bass/drums).

This is my personal site that I use to [write](/writing) about **design**, **code**, **A/B testing**, and other topics that interests me. A few of my most popular posts:
