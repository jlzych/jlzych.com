# Hi.

My name is Jeff Zych.

I enjoy writing about front-end programming, design, and A/B testing. I live in San Francisco and work as a **Product Designer & Developer** for [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com "Optimizely homepage"). I love working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create engaging products. I work closely with our [amazing](http://ryanmyersdesign.com "Ryan Myer's homepage") [designers](http://tommygiglio.com "Tommy Giglio's homepage") and researchers to develop simple and useful user experiences.

Before joining Optimizely, I earned my Master's degree at [UC Berkeley's](http://berkeley.edu "UC Berkeley's homepage") [School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu "School of Information's homepage"), where I studied human-computer interaction, usability, and behavioral economics.
