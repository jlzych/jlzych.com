# Hi.

<img src="/images/me.jpg" srcset="/images/me-2x.jpg 2x" alt="Picture of Jeff Zych" class="me" width="220" />
My name is Jeff Zych.

I use this blog to write about front-end programming, design, and A/B testing.

I live in San Francisco and work as a **UI Engineer** for [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com "Optimizely homepage"). I love working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create engaging user experiences. I also work closely with our [amazing](http://ryanmyersdesign.com "Ryan Myer's homepage") [designers](http://tommygiglio.com "Tommy Giglio's homepage") and UX researchers to develop simple, intuitive user interfaces.

Before joining Optimizely, I earned my Master's degree at [UC Berkeley's](http://berkeley.edu "UC Berkeley's homepage") [School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu "School of Information's homepage"), where I studied human-computer interaction, usability, and behavioral economics.
