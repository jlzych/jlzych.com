## I'm Jeff, a humane designer & technologist who's passionate about building products to improve people's lives.

I'm the former Head of Design at [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com "Optimizely homepage"). Before that I was a Product Designer and a [UI Engineer](https://medium.com/design-optimizely/why-we-hire-ui-engineers-on-optimizely-s-design-team-b2a789553b79#.a0dzb4xyl).

Before joining Optimizely, I earned my Master’s degree at UC Berkeley’s [School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu "School of Information's homepage"), where I studied technology, design, and behavioral economics. View my full [online resume here](/resume) (includes print styles!).

I'm also a tennis player and musician (guitar/bass/drums).

This is my personal site that I use to [write](/writing) about **design**, **code**, **A/B testing**, and other topics that interests me. A few of my most popular posts:

## A Few of My Beliefs About Design

- Design doesn't own the customer experience. A great customer experience is the emergent outcome of the contributions of every department.
- Design is not the center of the universe. Design is one function of many at an organization.
- Other departments have more customer contact than you. Listen to them.
- Don't hand your work down from on high and expect everyone to worship its genius. You need to bring people along for the ride so that they see how you got to your solution, and can get there themselves.
- Everyone can improve the customer's experience, not just designers. Foster an environment where everyone applies a user-centered mindset to their work.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Don't hide behind jargon and the cloak of the "creative."
- Design needs to be aligned to the needs of the business, and deliver measurable business value. Don't design for design's sake.
