I am currently in the process of redesigning Cityspan Inc.'s website, which is used to market their products (such as [youthservices.net](youthservices.html "YouthServices.net")), to potential clients. The existing website both looked outdated and had functional issues, such as being too text heavy and having overly complex navigation. Their Google Analytics data reported a bounce rate of over 80% on the landing page. A heuristic evaluation of their site revealed the current homepage is too text heavy with no clear call-to-action and unclear navigation options, which caused users to leave the site immediately. Therefore, I took a user-centered approach to determine user goals and make sure the content was aligned with those goals before attempting any design ideas. After Cityspan wrote new content I simplified the navigation, making sure it spoke the user's language, and created a new landing page with clear, concise headlines and a strong call to action. After implementing these changes there was a X% decrease in bounce rate. I am still working with Cityspan to further refine subpages.
