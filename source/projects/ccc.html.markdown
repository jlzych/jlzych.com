The Cal Cooking Club is a student run UC Berkeley club that aims to promote cooking among the student body. I was their webmaster during the 2010-2011 school year, during which time I completely redesigned their site from scratch and created a new logo for the club. I started with static HTML mock-ups so I could quickly iterate on design ideas. Once the officers and I converged on a design I developed a custom Wordpress theme so the club officers could update the site content themselves. View the site at [cooking.berkeley.edu][c].
