[Privacy Patterns](http://staging.privacypatterns.org) provides design solutions to common privacy problems, with the goal of translating "privacy-by-design" into practical advice for software engineering. Another student and I implemented the project from the ground up, but worked with a Ph.D student and alumnus who started the project and wrote content. My role was mainly focused on the design and layout of the site, and writing templates to implement those designs.
