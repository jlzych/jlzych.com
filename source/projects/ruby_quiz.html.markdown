Ruby Quiz is "a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers." I designed and wrote the HTML/CSS for the site, and another developer wired up the back-end. This was a quick project I did in early 2009, and there are numerous things I would improve were I to redesign it. For example, develop a grid and choose better typography. Additionally, I would re-implement everything according to modern HTML5 standards. View the site at [rubyquiz.strd6.com](http://rubyquiz.strd6.com/)
