              I’m Jeff, a multi-disciplinary product design leader

            %h2
              I'm passionate about unlocking the potential of design within organizations by designing the systems that design the product. I did this most recently at #{ link_to "Gladly", "https://www.gladly.com" } and #{ link_to "Optimizely", "https://www.optimizely.com" }.

        %section.about-content.about-story
          %p
            %span I ’ve defined my career by riding the line between design and code. I got my start building websites in high school, back when there was no distinction between “web design” and “web development,” and CSS wasn’t a “thing” yet. I indulged these twin interests by studying graphic communication and computer science at Cal Poly.

          %p After college I went down the programming path by joining Cityspan as a Data Warehouse Developer. Over time my design muse got restless and rescued me from the database by sending me to UC Berkeley’s School of Information. While there I cut my teeth on user-centered design, and learned a ton about sociology, law & policy, technology, research, design, behavioral economics, and more.

          %p
            While in grad school I took a class applying the learnings from behavioral economics to websites via <span class="text-small-caps">A/B</span> testing, which led me to join Optimizely after graduating. While there I continued moving between code and design, eventually becoming the head of the design team. In that role I #{ link_to "integrated research and design with the engineering team's Agile delivery process", "/2016/07/17/discovery-kanban-at-optimizely/" }, which helped teams focus on solving the biggest customer problems, and doubled the throughput of the design team. I also led the design systems team, which further brought design and engineering together while improved the quality of our UI.

          %p After 5 and half years I was ready for a change, so I joined Casetext to build modern, easy-to-use legal tech tools.

          %p Most recently I led the product design team at Gladly. While there I improved how teams designed & built features by documenting our end-to-end product development process, and defining the RACI for each stage. I also improved product quality by setting the vision for the team to ensure we’re pushing the product’s design forward in a consistent direction. Finally, I also led the design systems team, which improved product quality, and increased the speed of designing and building UIs

          %p Outside of work I like to play tennis, music (guitar, bass, and drums, but I’m pretty rusty now), <a href="/scribbles">hand letter</a>, write, and spend time with my lovely wife eating, drinking, and traveling.

            %h2 A Few of My Beliefs About Design

            %ul
              %li Design is not the center of the universe. Design is one function of many at an organization.
              %li Other departments have more customer contact than you. Listen to them.
              %li Design needs to be aligned to the needs of the business, and deliver measurable business value. Don't design for design's sake.
              %li Design doesn't own the customer experience. A great customer experience is the emergent outcome of the contributions of every department.
