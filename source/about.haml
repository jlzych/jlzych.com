          %h1 I’m Jeff, a humane designer & technologist.

          %h2 I’m passionate about building products that improve people’s lives. I’m currently managing the product design team at Gladly. Formerly at Optimizely and Casetext.

        .about-story
          %p My career has been defined by riding the line between design and code. I got my start building websites in high school, back when there was no distinction between “web design” and “web development,” and CSS wasn’t a “thing” yet. I indulged these twin interests by studying graphic communication and computer science at Cal Poly.

          %p After college I went down the programming path by joining Cityspan as a Data Warehouse Developer. Over time my design muse got restless and rescued me from the depths of the database by sending me to UC Berkeley’s School of Information. While there I cut my teeth on user-centered design, and learned a ton about topics ranging from sociology, law & policy, technology, research, design, behavioral economics, and more.

          %p
            After grad school I joined Optimizely, jumping between code and design, and eventually becoming the head of the design team. After 5 and half years it was time for a change, so I joined Casetext to transform the legal tech landscape. Now I’m at Gladly, spreading my code and design chops by managing the product design team.

          %p In my free time I like to play tennis, music (guitar, bass, and drums, but I’m pretty rusty now), hand letter, and write on this blog.

          %p
            This is my personal site that I use to <a href='/writing'>write</a> about <strong>design</strong>, <strong>code</strong>, <strong>A/B testing</strong>, and other topics that interests me.

        %h2 A Few of My Beliefs About Design

        %ul
          %li Design doesn't own the customer experience. A great customer experience is the emergent outcome of the contributions of every department.
          %li Design is not the center of the universe. Design is one function of many at an organization.
          %li Other departments have more customer contact than you. Listen to them.
          %li Done is better than perfect.
          %li Design needs to be aligned to the needs of the business, and deliver measurable business value. Don't design for design's sake.
