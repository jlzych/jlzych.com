I read 30 books in 2023, which is actually 5 more than [2022](https://jlzych.com/2023/01/02/2022-reading-list/) and 6 more than [2021](https://jlzych.com/2022/01/03/2021-reading-list/). Like the preceding years, this year felt lower than the previous years but was actually higher (very much buoyed by visual books like *Practical UI* and *Arcade Game Typography*).

I only read 6 fiction books this year, which I thought was surprisingly low until I checked last year and it was 3 times higher, hah. My most-read category is art/design/creativity (11), which is both because I find those most interesting and gobble them up, and also because many of them are visual and low in words. I did better this year at reading books by women (8 — same as last year) and people of color (8).

## Faves

- *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow* by Gabrielle Zevin: This book was written about a lot in last year’s reading lists, but I didn’t get to it until 2023 and it did not disappoint. It’s the story of a creative partnership and friendship and how that changes and evolves over decades. And it’s all centered around video games (especially 80s and 90s “retro” games), which hits the nostalgia factor *hard* for me.
- *[Practical UI](https://www.practical-ui.com/)* by Adham Dannaway: A great book of practical UI tips and tricks to up your UI and visual design game. Instant recommend for anyone getting started in UI design, or for design veterans who are looking for more tricks to add to their toolbelt (alongside [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger).
- *The Creative Act: A Way of Being* by Rick Rubin: By far the best book on creativity I’ve read in a long time. Probably ever. Every chapter and paragraph and line and word felt meaningful and like I was only understanding a fraction of the deeper meaning. Rick writes about creativity in a philosophical, mystical way that’s applicable to any creative endeavor, not just music (I saw it described as being written in the style of the *Tao Te Ching*, which I haven’t read but seems apt). I found it so inspiring that I keep a copy on my desk and flip to random pages sometimes to give me guidance. I keep a couple of post-its on my monitor of quotes from the book (a sample: “If you begin with a question and use it to guide an adventure of discovery, that’s the work of the artist.”).
- *White Teeth* by Zadie Smith: This was a recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. The writing is sharp and witty, the characters have depth, and it felt like a movie playing in my head while I read it.
- *Arcade Game Typography: The art of pixel type* by Toshi Omagari: This was a really cool book documenting and classifying 8x8 pixel type that was used in early video games. I was impressed by the amount of variety that people came up with in such a small grid! It’s a largely visual book, and anyone who played early video games would enjoy flipping through it.
- *Jungalow: Decorate Wild* by Justina Blakeney: I believe this is the first interior decorating book I’ve read, and I found it very inspiring. Justina has an eclectic and unique style that I enjoy, but more importantly she encourages exploration and trying things out and finding what you like over following “rules” set by others. I’ve noticed this as a meta-trend with myself: I’m drawn to creatives who have unique and expressive styles and advocate finding what works for you rather than what other people say is “right” or “wrong” (such as the chefs Molly Baez and Samin Nosrat).
- *Booze and Vinyl* by Andre and Tenaya Darlington: This was a Christmas present from last year that pairs a classic vinyl record with 2 cocktails (one for each side). The intentionality of putting on a record and making a pair of cocktails to sip on while listening really resonated with me. The authors throw parties like this which I’ve been holding in the back of my head to do some day. It inspired me to purchase some vinyl and make a some new cocktails!

Lastly, I read a couple of classics this year: *The Catcher in the Rye* by J. D. Salinger, and *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath. Both classics for a reason, although neither “wow!”-ed me or changed my life. I had read *Catcher* in high school, and it’s so much easier to see how full of shit Holden is as an adult. I had never read *The Bell Jar* before, and I can see how it could be really meaningful for folks in high school and college.
