I completely agree with this [view on mastery](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/isaac-mizrahi-on-unapologetically-pursuing-your-interests/) from American fashion designer, writer, television personality, entrepreneur, and occasional cabaret star Isaac Mizrahi:

> I’m a person who’s interested in doing a bunch of things. It’s just what I like. I like it better than doing one thing over and over. This idea of mastery—of being the very best at just one thing—is not in my future. I don’t really care _that_ much. I care about doing things that are interesting to me and that I don’t lose interest in.

Mastery – “being the very best at just one thing” – doesn’t hold much appeal for me. I’m a very curious person. I like jumping between various creative endeavors that “are interesting to me and that I don’t lose interest in.” Guitar, web design, coding, [writing](/writing), [hand lettering](/2017/10/29/my-progress-with-hand-lettering/) – these are just some of the creative paths I’ve gone down so far, and I know that list will continue to grow.

I’ve found that my understanding of one discipline fosters a deeper understanding of other disciplines. New skills don’t take away from each other – they only add.

So no, mastery isn’t for me. The more creative paths I go down, the better. Keep ‘em coming.
