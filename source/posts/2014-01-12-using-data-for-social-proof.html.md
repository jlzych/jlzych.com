I recently ran a test on Optimizely's [free trial signup page](https://www.optimizely.com/free-trial) that's a great example of using social proof to increase conversions. I've [written about social proof](/2013/08/02/everyones-reading-this-increase-conversions-with-social-proof/) before, but the gist of the idea is that telling a person other people are already using your product or service makes them more likely to also use it. Knowing other people have already taken a particular action reduces perceived risk.

The free trial signup page is a search engine marketing page that people land on when coming from an ad. The page started out as a simple signup form with an image to illustrate A/B testing, whose primary goal is to get people to sign up for [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com). I created a variation that displayed the total number of visitors tested and experiments run with Optimizely, which are live counters that tick up in real time. I wanted to see if using data to demonstrate how many people are already using Optimizely was an effective form of social proof.

_Variation with the total visitors tested and experiments run as social proof._

The test was a definitive win that resulted in an 8.7% lift in sign ups. The change itself was relatively simple (i.e. easy to design, easy to implement), but the test further proved the power of social proof.
