On a chilly fall day a few weeks back, I gave a talk at the cozy [Lean Kanban Central Europe](http://www.leankanbance.com/) in Hamburg, Germany. I was honored to be invited to give a reprise of the [talk I gave with Keith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Ns5bdg0oo&list=PLVsUnwOzPqiSz8D0WYoUkKxZzzbmM0pPY&index=14) earlier this year at Lean Kanban North America.

I spoke about Optimizely's software development process, and how we've used ideas from Lean Kanban and ESP (Enterprise Service Planning) to help us ship faster, with higher quality, to better meet customer needs. Overall it went well, but I had too much content and rushed at the end. If I do this talk again, I would cut some slides and make the presentation more focused and concise. Watch the talk below.
