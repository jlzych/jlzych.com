I just published my first Skillshare class — [Discovery Kanban 101: How to Integrate User-Centered Design with Agile](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Discovery-Kanban-101-How-to-Integrate-User-Centered-Design-with-Agile/677077315?teacherRef=748023&via=teacher-referral&utm_campaign=teacher-referral&utm_source=ShortUrl&utm_medium=teacher-referral). From the class description:

> Learn how to make space for designers and researchers to do user-centered design in an Agile/scrum engineering environment. By creating an explicit Discovery process to focus on customer needs before committing engineers to shipping code, you will unlock design’s potential to deliver **great user experiences** to your customers.
>
> By the end of this class, you will have built a Discovery Kanban board and learned how to use it to plan and manage the work of your team.

While I was at Optimizely, I implemented a Discovery kanban process to improve the effectiveness of my design team (which I blogged about previously [here](/2016/07/17/discovery-kanban-at-optimizely/) and [here](/2016/09/20/managing-design-work-with-discovery-kanban-at-optimizely/), and spoke about [here](/2017/11/26/my-talk-at-lean-kanban-central-europe-2017/)). I took the lessons I learned from doing that and turned them into a class on Skillshare to help any design leader implement an explicit Discovery process at their organization.

Whether you're a design manager, a product designer, a program manager, a product manager, or just someone who's interested in user-centered design, I hope you find this course valuable. If you have any thoughts or questions, don't hesitate to reach out: [@jlzych](https://twitter.com/jlzych)
