![The antique pitcher I found](/images/2023-pitcher/pitcher.jpeg)

I found this antique pitcher outside an apartment building today. It was amongst some discarded books and knick-knacks, most of which was junk, but then there was this pitcher. I normally would have just left it, but this pitcher held my attention.

I felt myself coming up with all the reasons I should just leave it: "I don't need it." "It's old." "It's discarded junk." But then I stopped myself and decided to take it home.

Why did I do this? Two threads came together to inspire me: the first was Justina Blakeney's book, _Jungalow_. In this interior design book, she talks about finding old stuff at markets, swamp meets, antique fairs, etc., and giving them new life. Re-using them, remixing them, incorporating them into home decor, and so on.

The second was a note I keep on my desk, which I saw in _The Creative Act_ by Rick Rubin (the best book Ive read on creativity in a long time): "Base decisions on the internal feeling of being moved. Notice what holds your interest."

This pitcher was holding my interest! I didn't really know why, but that's not the point. The point is I should base decisions off of this feeling, without the need to rationalize it. I both noticed this was holding my interest, and also noticed that my old thought patterns were telling me all the reasons to discard that thought. So I did the opposite and followed what held my interest.

These two threads came together to change change my behavior. The pitcher is now more than a pitcher â€“ it's a symbol of my ongoing journey to reach my creative potential.
