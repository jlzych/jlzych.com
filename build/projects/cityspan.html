        <h1>Cityspan.com</h1>
        <p>I am currently in the process of redesigning Cityspan Inc.&#8217;s website, which is used to market their products (such as <a href='youthservices.html' title='YouthServices.net'>youthservices.net</a>), to potential clients. The existing website both looked outdated and had functional issues, such as being too text heavy and having overly complex navigation. Their Google Analytics data reported a bounce rate of over 80% on the landing page. A heuristic evaluation of their site revealed the current homepage is too text heavy with no clear call-to-action and unclear navigation options, which caused users to leave the site immediately. Therefore, I took a user-centered approach to determine user goals and make sure the content was aligned with those goals before attempting any design ideas. After Cityspan wrote new content I simplified the navigation, making sure it spoke the user&#8217;s language, and created a new landing page with clear, concise headlines and a strong call to action. After implementing these changes there was a X% decrease in bounce rate. I am still working with Cityspan to further refine subpages.</p>
