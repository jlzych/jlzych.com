        I am a user interface designer who enjoys puzzling over how to create clean, useful web apps with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Currently I'm a 2nd year Masters student at UC Berkeley's

          <a href="/projects/youthservices.html">YouthServices.net</a>
          <p>Youthservices.net is a web-based attendance tracking tool used by providers of youth service programs, such as non-profit organizations and school districts. The system is not intuitive to learn and many common tasks could be streamlined. For these reasons my partner and I used this application as a class project for Info 213 – User Interface Design and Development (http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/213). Our design process started with contextual inquiries, personas, tasks, and affinity diagrams, then moved on to paper prototyping, Balsamiq prototypes, and finally ended with an interactive prototype. We conducted usability tests along the way to optimize key tasks. Task times and number of errors for each task were measured against the existing site, in addition to a post-test survey to capture the user’s opinions of the prototype. Feedback from users during and after the tests was positive. The usability testing allowed us to pinpoint the successes and flaws of the new prototype. Overall, the participants were satisfied with the new prototype more than the original site. Read the full report here.</p>

          <a href="/projects/cityspan.html">Cityspan.com</a>
          <p>I am currently in the process of redesigning Cityspan Inc.&#8217;s website, which is used to market their products (such as <a href='youthservices.html' title='YouthServices.net'>youthservices.net</a>), to potential clients. The existing website both looked outdated and had functional issues, such as being too text heavy and having overly complex navigation. Their Google Analytics data reported a bounce rate of over 80% on the landing page. A heuristic evaluation of their site revealed the current homepage is too text heavy with no clear call-to-action and unclear navigation options, which caused users to leave the site immediately. Therefore, I took a user-centered approach to determine user goals and make sure the content was aligned with those goals before attempting any design ideas. After Cityspan wrote new content I simplified the navigation, making sure it spoke the user&#8217;s language, and created a new landing page with clear, concise headlines and a strong call to action. After implementing these changes there was a X% decrease in bounce rate. I am still working with Cityspan to further refine subpages.</p>

          <a href="/projects/privacypatterns.html">PrivacyPatterns.org</a>
          <p><a href='http://staging.privacypatterns.org'>Privacy Patterns</a> provides design solutions to common privacy problems, with the goal of translating &#8220;privacy-by-design&#8221; into practical advice for software engineering. Another student and I implemented the project from the ground up, but worked with a Ph.D student and alumnus who started the project and wrote content. My role was mainly focused on the design and layout of the site, and writing templates to implement those designs.</p>

          <a href="/projects/get_cozy.html">Get Cozy!</a>
          <p>Get Cozy is a prototype of a simple beverage reminder system, made as a class project for <a href='http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/262'>Info 262, Theory and Practice of Tangible User Interfaces</a>. From personal experience, hot tea is often forgotten on the counter until cold or overstepped. We applied a user centered design process to solve this problem, and created a solution to subtlety remind the user of their waiting tea without interrupting the calming ritual of drinking tea. Inspired by mugs with removable handles and DIY wearables, we prototyped a removable mug cozy that doubles as a bracelet. Individuals can easily slip on this cozy and simply go to another room. As the tea cools, the mug wirelessly communicates with the cozy, which slowly changes color to reflect the tea&#8217;s current temperature. This subtle notification acts as a reminder that there is tea in the other room which is slowly cooling without being obtrusive or distracting.</p>

          <a href="/projects/ruby_quiz.html">Ruby Quiz</a>
          <p>Ruby Quiz is &#8220;a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers.&#8221; I designed and wrote the HTML/CSS for the site, and another developer wired up the back-end. This was a quick project I did in early 2009, and there are numerous things I would improve were I to redesign it. For example, develop a grid and choose better typography. Additionally, I would re-implement everything according to modern HTML5 standards. View the site at <a href='http://rubyquiz.strd6.com/'>rubyquiz.strd6.com</a></p>

          <p>The Cal Cooking Club is a student run UC Berkeley club that aims to promote cooking among the student body. I was their webmaster during the 2010-2011 school year, during which time I completely redesigned their site from scratch and created a new logo for the club. I started with static HTML mock-ups so I could quickly iterate on design ideas. Once the officers and I converged on a design I developed a custom Wordpress theme so the club officers could update the site content themselves. View the site at <span>cooking.berkeley.edu</span>.
