    <p id="about">I am a user interface designer who enjoys puzzling over how to create clean, useful web apps with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Currently I'm a 1st year Masters student at UC Berkeley's <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu" title="School of Information home page">School of Information</a>, soaking up as much knowledge as I can about information and technology. View some of my recent projects below:</p>

      <a href="http://cooking.berkeley.edu" title="Cal Cooking Club">Cal Cooking Club</a>
      <span>Cal Cooking Club website for which I am the sole designer and developer. Started as sketches, which I turned into a static site before porting to a Wordpress theme. I'm actively working on this now, refining the layout, typography, and features.<span>

        <a href="pixie.pdf" title="Pixie">Pixie (pdf)</a>
        <span>This is a browser-based drawing application for which I was the sole UI designer. The site is targeted towards the creation of sprite art for use in games. Screenshots show the “About” page and the actual drawing page. <a href="http://pixie.strd6.com" title="Pixie">Live site (considerably different now)</a></span>

        <span>Front end design and coding; backend was done by another developer. A few years old at this point, definitely some things I would do differently today were I to redesign it (such as develop a grid and refine the typography).</span>
